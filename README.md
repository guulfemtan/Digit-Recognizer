# ✍️ Digit Recognizer (MNIST)

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using the **MNIST** dataset.  
The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify digits based on pixel values.

The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and basic visualization, and was developed in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Dataset
- **MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset**
- Grayscale images of digits (0–9)
- Each image represented as pixel intensity values

---

## Methodology
- Data normalization and reshaping
- Supervised learning model training
- Validation-based performance evaluation
- Visualization of predictions and misclassified samples

---

## Model Performance
